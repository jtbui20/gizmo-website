# Gizmo Website

## Developing

Using yarn but npm will work anyways.

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Bulding

```bash
yarn build
```

## Dynamic Content

Because we are deploying as a static website, we will need to manually update the contents in `src/data/`, then rebuild and redeploy the website.

- About section content
- Features section content
